# Ultrasonic-Sensor-Obtruction-Avoidance-
The goal of this project is to simultaneoulsy use 8 Ultrasonic Sensors to Detect Object and avoid them 

This Code is is to work with THe ROS Operating Software on Linux. 

There are 8 Ultrasonic Sensors in total. 
  - 4 infront 
  - 4 at the back 
 It is part of bigger project which is to develop an utonomous vehicle that uses multiple Real time sensors to percieve the enviroment. 
 (Using multiple sensors) 
 
 The Ultrasonic sensor's m,ain purpose is to detect shro range obstrructions and inform the main computer of the robot.
